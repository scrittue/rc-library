    <h2>OUR COLLECTION</h2>
    <p class="text_column">The founding items of our collection represented a wide myriad of knowledge and interests. There were cookbooks, short story anthologies, anthropological theory, astrophysics textbooks, creative writing craft books, zines, chapbooks, small press publishings, vintage leather bound copies, and so much more. Today we continue that tradition and continue to gather pieces for every body and every mind.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Our music catalog includes complete instrumental and vocal scores, sheet music for individual parts, as well as a collection of popular classic masses and messiahs. If there is a piece we don't have available through our catalog, we encourage you to take a look at our pals' items over at the International&nbsp; Music Score Library Project.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    <h2 class="parallax">LOCATION</h2>
    <p class="parallax_description">R&amp;C Library is nestled in Sunderland, MA. Established in 2016, we're excited to finally bring our resources and collection to a brick and mortar front in Western Massachusetts.
      <br>
      <br>We have our humble origins in friendship, comradery, and community.
      <br>What started as a causal exchange amongst friends has now evolved into a resource for professionals and performers throughout the valley.
      <br>
      <br>Enjoy a book or cup of coffee in our reading nook, or check out items and head up nearby Mount Sugarloaf for a quick hike and sweet view.</p>
